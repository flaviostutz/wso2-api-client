# wso2-api-client

JS lib for invoking WSO2APIM Rest APIs for managing published APIs. Typescript friendly.

Most of this codebase was autogenerated from [Swagger APIs found at the official website](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.2.0/develop/product-apis/overview/). On top of it we added a client layer based on [openapi-fetch](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript)

Currently only WSO2APIM v3 is supported.

Some pieces of code and experiences were extracted from [serverless-wso2-apim](https://github.com/ramgrandhi/serverless-wso2-apim). Thanks, Ram!
